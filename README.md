Welcome to the *Design Patterns* repository — simple, clear Java examples to help you learn clean architecture and scalable code.

## 🌟 What Are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are **proven solutions** to common programming problems. They make code **flexible, reusable, and maintainable**.

---

## 🔐 Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** – ensure one instance.
- **Factory** – encapsulate object creation.
- **Builder** – build complex objects step-by-step.
- **Prototype** – clone existing objects.

---

## 🔄 Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** – connect incompatible interfaces.
- **Facade** – simple interface over complex subsystems.
- **Decorator** – add behavior dynamically.
- **Proxy** – control access to objects.

---

## ⚙️ Behavioral Patterns
- **Strategy** – swap algorithms at runtime.
- **Observer** – notify on state change.
- **Command** – encapsulate actions as objects.
- **Iterator** – traverse collections.
